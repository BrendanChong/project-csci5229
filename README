Level-Set phase visualizer for MORIS GUI

author: Brendan Chong
TOTAL TIME: 40 hours?

The project is intended to be used alongside a Qt GUI (in development) for an immersed Finite Element codebase.
In the code, geometries are defined by the union of Level-Set functions defined over the mesh domain. Each Level-Set function can either be positive, negative, or zero.

To map the Level-Set to a phase, and eventually a material in the physics problem, a phase table must be specified. The phase table provides a phase index to every possible combination of +/- for each geometry. Thus, the phase table is necessarily of size 2^num_geometries. The default phase table for 3 geometries is listed below

        Level-Set Field index  
            0   1   2
---------------------------------------
Phase 0 |   -   -   -   |
Phase 1 |   -   -   +   |
Phase 2 |   -   +   -   |
Phase 3 |   -   +   +   |
Phase 4 |   +   -   -   |
Phase 5 |   +   -   +   |
Phase 6 |   +   +   -   |
Phase 7 |   +   +   +   |

Note that multiple bitsets (combinations of +/- for each geometry) can be mapped to the same index. This code shows both the plots of the Level-Set functions, as well as the resulting phase distribution. It allows for arbitrary Level-Set functions to be added at the user discretion and different phase tables to be assigned.

-------CONTROLS---------
    GENERAL:
        mouse   : Click and drag to rotate the Level-Set geometries and view different features
        scroll  : Move the z-clipping plane forward and backward
        l       : Toggles lighting
        / or ?  : Loads demo. Auto-loaded by default, so will not do anything unless geometries have been changed
        Space   : Display all bitsets in the projection view and all Level-Sets in the plotter view.
        q       : Swaps the viewports (plotter view <-> projection view)
        

    LEVEL-SET ASSIGNMENTS:
        n       : Add a new Level-Set geometry (maximum 5). A prompt will appear in the terminal to type the function
        0-4     : View only the Level-Set geometry assigned to that index
        Enter   : Edits the currently active geometry (Ex. press 1, Enter to change the equation for LS1)
        d       : Deletes the current Level-Set geometry and shifts the remaining geometries down. If all geometries are currently being viewed, it will delete geometry 0
        i       : Toggles bisection method to supplement points along the zero isocontour

    PHASE CONTROLS:
        p       : Set entire phase table. A prompt will appear in the terminal to type a comma or space separated vector for the phase table.
                  Note that the phase table is visualized on the screen
        _       : (Underscore) Views phase 0 since there is no F0 key
        F1-F12  : View the phase associated with that key (ie. F1 shows phase 1). The view is populated on both the main plot viewer as well as the projection
        +       : Shows the regions where any currently viewed Level-Sets are positive
        -       : Shows the regions where any currently viewed Level-Sets are negative
        Right Click : If the projection is the main view, right clicking a bitset selects it. Pressing the enter key while in this state will allow the user to change the phase for the selected bitset only.
        r       : Resets the phase table to set every bitset to a unique phase index.
